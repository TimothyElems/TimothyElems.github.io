While the season is still on everyone's minds, the League gives its players a questionnaire with a simple question: name the top 100 players in the league this season!

<!-- At the end of a season, the NFL gives it's players a simple questionnaire to fill out. They seek the players own thoughts on one issue: who were the top 100 players of the recently concluded season? -->
